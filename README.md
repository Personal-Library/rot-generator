# ROT# Generator

## Description

This web application allows users to generate ROT code with any number of alphabetical rotation.

## Technologies

- Vue.js
- Vue Router

## Installation

Clone the repository

`git@github.com:Personal-Library/rot-generator.git`

Move into the created directory

`cd rot-generator`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Start the development server

`npm run serve`

## Usage

The user can enter their text and generate their code by selecting the number of characters
they wish to rotate their text by. Note that only alphabetical characters are rotated, while
numeric and special characters are left as is.

## Future Ideas

- Implement some sort of global state so that the description section can describe the base input
  as well as the rotated input
- Add some sort of color scheme/upgraded styling
- Implement a dictionary scheme for an auto-decoder, making it so the user doesn't have to
  click and manually decipher their code
